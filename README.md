# Zero-knowledge (ZK) Tax

We introduce a zero-knowledge (ZK) tax disclosure system that allows users to redact sensitive personal information from their tax records while providing verifiable proof of the redacted data. We implement a proof of concept prototype, compatible with the 2020 US income tax return Form 1040. 

Demo:

The code to run the app (including react code and circom circuit) can be found in `app/`.
